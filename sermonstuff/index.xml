      <description>August 28, 2022 Kingdom Living Part 1: Listening to Jesus 3 Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 4 Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. (Matthew 5:3-4)
Identity shift means repentance. Your reaction &amp;ldquo;comes from&amp;rdquo; who you are.
(v.3) Spiritual poverty implies total inability which needs God&amp;rsquo;s charity (cf. Luke 18:10-14).
Look upward, not inward.
Where is your heart? Do you tolerate your spiritual pride rather than pursue humility?</description>

      <description>September 4, 2022 Kingdom Living Part 2: Listening to Jesus 5 Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. 6 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. (Matthew 5:5-6)
(v.5) There is an upside-down paradox &amp;ndash; it does not look blessing for us.
The word &amp;ldquo;meek&amp;rdquo; does not mean &amp;lsquo;weak/shy/coward&amp;rsquo; but mean &amp;lsquo;gentle/humble&amp;rsquo; (strength that accommodates others&amp;rsquo; weakness).
&amp;ldquo;Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness.</description>

      <description>September 11, 2022 Kingdom Living Part 3: Listening to Jesus 7 Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy. 8 Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. (Matthew 5:7-8)
Life is not just primarily about you at all. This seems so countercultural!
Put yourself LAST if you want to live a full life. No.1: Lord, No.2: Others, and No.3: You. Gospel humility is seeking to love God and others.</description>

      <description>September 18, 2022 Kingdom Living Part 4: Listening to Jesus 9 “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God. 10 “Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 11 “Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. 12 Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</description>

      <description>September 25, 2022 Kingdom Living Part 5: Listening to Jesus Salt and Light
13 &amp;ldquo;You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people&amp;rsquo;s feet. 14 &amp;ldquo;You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. 15 Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house.</description>

      <description>October 2, 2022 Kingdom Living Part 6: Listening to Jesus &amp;ldquo;Live in Joyful Obedience&amp;rdquo; Christ Came to Fulfill the Law
17 “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. 18 For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished.</description>

      <description>October 9, 2022 Kingdom Living Part 7: Listening to Jesus Anger
21 “You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.’ 22 But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be liable to the hell of fire.</description>

      <description>October 16, 2022 Kingdom Living Part 8: Listening to Jesus Lust
27 “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ 28 But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 29 If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell.</description>
