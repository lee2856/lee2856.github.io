      <description>August 28, 2022 Kingdom Living Part 1: Listening to Jesus 3 Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 4 Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. (Matthew 5:3-4)
Identity shift means repentance. Your reaction &amp;ldquo;comes from&amp;rdquo; who you are.
(v.3) Spiritual poverty implies total inability which needs God&amp;rsquo;s charity (cf. Luke 18:10-14).
Look upward, not inward.
Where is your heart? Do you tolerate your spiritual pride rather than pursue humility?</description>

      <description>September 4, 2022 Kingdom Living Part 2: Listening to Jesus 5 Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. 6 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. (Matthew 5:5-6)
(v.5) There is an upside-down paradox &amp;ndash; it does not look blessing for us.
The word &amp;ldquo;meek&amp;rdquo; does not mean &amp;lsquo;weak/shy/coward&amp;rsquo; but mean &amp;lsquo;gentle/humble&amp;rsquo; (strength that accommodates others&amp;rsquo; weakness).
&amp;ldquo;Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness.</description>
